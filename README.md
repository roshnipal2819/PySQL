# Data Management and Processing Course Notebooks

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks from my Data Management and Processing course. The primary task involved using Python and MySQL to interact with an existing MySQL database known as the university database. 

Included in this repository are the DDL files to set up the university database. The notebooks showcase various SQL queries performed to extract meaningful insights from the database. 

Feel free to explore the notebooks to understand the queries and the insights derived from the data.
